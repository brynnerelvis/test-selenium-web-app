### Atonomy of the Test Case ID: 

Example: _sd_uc01_001_

_sd_: The first letter represents short for the application that is in test. (Here we use _sd_ because the application is called Sauce Demo).

_uc01_: This is to indicate which usecase the test belongs to. (Here we use _uc01_ which represents Use Case 1).

_001_: This is to indicate the number of the test case. (Here we use _001_ to indicate that this is the first test case for the usecase).
